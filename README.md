# Student Exam Score Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting students' exam scores based on various features such as the number of hours studied, previous exam scores, and attendance. By employing regression techniques, the goal is to build a model that accurately estimates a student's exam score from these input features. This project provides valuable insights into the factors that influence student performance and can assist educators in identifying students who may require additional support.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

- Develop a predictive model to estimate exam scores using regression techniques.
- Analyze the influence of different features on student performance.
- Provide actionable insights to help educators support students who are struggling.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle:

- [Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/impapan/student-performance-data-set)

This dataset includes various features related to students' academic performance, such as:

- Hours studied
- Previous exam scores
- Attendance

## Process

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Load and examine the dataset to understand its structure and the relationships between features.
   - Visualize data distributions and correlations.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, if any.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features if necessary.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features that might enhance the model's performance.
   - Select relevant features based on their importance.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Use various regression techniques such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
   - Train the models using the prepared dataset.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (RÂ²), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Fine-tune models to improve accuracy.

6. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Analyze the results to understand which features have the most significant impact on exam scores.
   - Provide recommendations for educators based on the findings.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of regression techniques to predict student exam scores. By leveraging the power of data and machine learning, we aim to provide educators with tools to better support their students and enhance their educational outcomes.
